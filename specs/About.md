This arm is meant to be put together with as few parts as possible, to achieve mechanical simplicity while maintaining good arm control. 

Currently the control system is based on:
- Arduino Mega 2560 
- Arduino Mega Sensor Shield
- 12V SLA Battery/7.2V NiMH batteries
- Copious amounts of turnpots and servos

There's a possibility of including relays or manual switches for use with an electromagnet. Alternatively, a strong ferromagnet can be used, and the same actuator used for gripping/intaking can be used to "push" an object attracted to the magnet off.

Actuation is done by:
- Denso Window Motor (base)
- RS775/PG188 gearmotor (shoulder)
- Globe gearmotor (elbow)
- HS645MG (wrist rotate)
- HS422HD/HS322 (wrist)
- ??? (end effector)
